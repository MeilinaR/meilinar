### Hi, I am Meilina 👋🏼

I am currently a Data & AI Consultant at [inin](https://www.inin.nl/), where I am spearheading data strategy initiatives and delivering data science solutions for clients in (mostly) the public sector. Pleasure to e-meet you! I have a background in artificial intelligence and data science, and I am particularly drawn to meaningful applications of data and software engineering for social good, education, and (bio)medicine. My primary interests are in the field of AI Safety + the application of AI in the life and natural sciences.
