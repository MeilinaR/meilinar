### Hi, I am Meilina 👋🏼

I am currently an MSc student in Data Science in Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Pleasure to e-meet you! I have a background in artificial intelligence and data science, and I am quite passionate about explainable AI, geometric deep learning and de novo drug discovery. Currently working on some projects related to that, so stay tuned!

- 🧠 I am currently learning more about geometric DL and drug discovery, so feel free to forward me any resources :)
- 💬 Ask me about XAI, responsible data science and fair and interpretable machine learning 🔥
- 🏃 Fun fact, I took up competitive running and road cycling this year! Ran a few fun 5K/10K races in the Netherlands and got 🥈 in the Team Time Trial at the GNSK this year. I am currently training for a sub-2h half marathon in 2023 :)
