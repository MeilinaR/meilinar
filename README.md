### Hi, I'm Meilina 👋🏼

I'm currently an MSc student in Data Science in Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Pleasure to e-meet you! I have a background in artificial intelligence and data science, and I'm quite passionate about responsible data science, geometric deep learning and quantum AI. Currently working on some projects related to that, so stay tuned!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an exciting MSc thesis on using equivariant normalizing flows for drug discovery. 
- 🧠 I’m currently learning more about geometric DL and XAI, so feel free to forward me any resources :)
- 💬 Ask me about XAI, responsible data science and fair and interpretable machine learning 🔥
- 🏃 Fun fact, I took up competitive running and cycling earlier this year. Looking forward to my first competitions in 2022!
