### Hi, I'm Meilina 👋🏼

I'm currently an MSc student in Data Science in Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Pleasure to e-meet you! I have a background in artificial intelligence and data science, and I'm quite passionate about responsible data science, geometric deep learning and quantum AI. Currently working on some projects related to that, so stay tuned!

- 🔭 I’m currently working an exciting thesis proposal on equivariant graph neural networks for drug discovery. Additionally, I'm working at Utrecht Data School on some exciting projects on the datafication and algorithmization of society.
- 🧠 I’m currently learning more about quantum AI and AutoML, so feel free to forward me any resources :)
- 💬 Ask me about XAI, responsible data science and fair and interpretable machine learning 🔥
- 🏃 Fun fact, I took up competetive running and cycling earlier this year. Looking forward to my first competitions in 2022!
